ROS Environment Not Sourced
For your shell to recognize which ROS distribution (like Noetic, Melodic, Humble, etc.) 
you are using, you must execute a setup file provided by the ROS installation.
$ source /opt/ros/noeticsetup.bash

Sourcing is Not Permanent
The source command only applies the environment variables to the current terminal session.
When you open a new terminal, you lose the ROS environment and need to source the setup file again.
Permanent Solution: To make this setting permanent for all new terminal sessions, 
you should add the source command to your shell's startup file (usually ~/.bashrc):
$ echo "source /opt/ros/<your_distro>/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ rosversion -d
noetic
